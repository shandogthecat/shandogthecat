# Hello!

### My name is Shannon, and welcome to my GitHub! üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å≥Û†Å£Û†Å¥Û†Åø

#### I am choosing to keep my repos private until they are in a state I am happy with. As projects are complete, and code has been refactored to my standards, then they will show up as public.

##### I am currently working on:
:open_book: A web app that will allow you receive recomendations for works to read (based on what you have already read) on [Archive of our Own](https://archiveofourown.org)

:black_nib: A web app to extract and format tags attached to posts on [Tumblr](https://tumblr.com) to allow a way to easily copy them to your own posts

:chart_with_upwards_trend: A personal dashboard (displayed as a home page on my browser) to display relevant information to my life, such as the status of my self-hosted applications from my Linux home server, my health data from my iPhone, and the progress I am making on my personal and coding goals using the data captured from [Beeminder](https://www.beeminder.com), [WakaTime](/wakatime.com/dashboard), and GitHub itself.
